# Exercise in GO

In this repository we can find 4 exercises proposed in the subject algorithm and programming, which were done in the GO language, I want to comment that it was the first time that I worked with it, and I am really grateful for it hahaha since its syntax is so Simple allows you to understand the basis of the functions and different methods that we use in the languages. It is important to have a solid foundation, in order to move forward.
With the resolution of the exercises, I studied a lot what arrays are, until we mastered them, which were essential for their development. The one that cost me the most was number 3. I really spent hours thinking about how to do it, but at the end of the day I achieved it

In conclusion, thank Professor Jose for his time invested and the knowledge shared for his students.

Thank you...
